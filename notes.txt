--- KEY TERMS ---

Return: Gain/Loss of a security during a period, consists of income + capital gains on an investment, usually in percentage.

Risk: The chance that an investment's return will be different from expected, includes the possibility to lose the original investment. Measured by standard deviation of historical returns or average return of specific investment.

Arbitrage: A simultaneous buy and sell of asset to profit from difference in price, price differences of identical instruments, on different markets, or different forms.

--- Portfolio manager ---

Expense ratio: usually less then 1%
Two and twenty: 2% of assets under management + 20% of returns

--- Investors ---

Individuals
Institutions (Foundations etc.)
Funds of Funds (Other hedge funds etc.)

Must have a track record, or very compelling strategy and "back test" (simulations), fit in a "pigeon hole".

Types of fund goals (Benchmark fund vs. absolute return fund): Reference to a benchmark by comparing with other funds (pigeon hole), absolute return (lower risk, always positive etc.).

--- Benchmark ---

Eg. Dow Jones Index compared to specific fund over time.

--- Common metrics ---

Annual return: How much is the money making each year?
Risk: Standard deviation of return, as mentioned above, volatility, draw down (lower is better).
Reward/Risk: Sharpe Ratio (reward divided by risk), Sortino Ratio, Jensen's alpha.

--- Annual return example --- 

(value[end] / value[start]) - 1
(100 / 110) - 1 = 0.10 = 10%

--- Standard deviation of daily return ---

i -> day

daily_rets[i] = (value[i] / value[i - 1]) - 1
std_metric = stdev(daily_rets)

--- Max draw down ---

Difference between local max and low over time.

--- Compare similar portfolios ---

Sharpe ratio: Most important measure of asset performance, calculate compensation for risk, the higher ratio the better (more return same risk).

i -> day
k -> sqrt(250) for daily returns (250 is equal to the number of days in a trading year, 12 for monthly returns)

daily_rets[i] = (value[i] / value[i - 1]) - 1
metric = k * mean(daily_rets) / stdev(daily_rets)

--- Sharpe ratio example ---

mean(daily return) = 0.005
stdev(daily) = 0.04

sqrt(250) * 0.005 / 0.04 = 1.97...

--- Types of orders ---

Req information:
Symbol
Buy, Sell
Market, Limit
Shares
Price (if Limit)

Example: Order = IBM,BUY,MARKET,100 -> Broker -> Exchange

--- The Order Book ---

Example:
Ask USD 100.10 100
Ask USD 100.05 500
Ask USD 100.00 1000
Bid USD  99.95 100
Bid USD  99.90 50
Bid USD  99.85 50

Spread: Difference in order book ask/bid quantity.

Crossing the spread: Increase/Lower price to meet asking/bid price for share.

Market order: Buy/Sell a specific amount of shares for lowest price available.

Sell short (to open): Bet against a stock.

--- Short selling ---

Borrow the shares -> Sell them = Cash asset, owed shares liability

Example:

- Borrow 100 shares
- Sell 100 shares on the market
Asset USD 10,000
Liability 100 shares

- Buy 100 shares for USD 9900
- Give back 100 shares
Asset USD 100
Liability 0

Net profit USD 100

High risk.

--- Market mechanics (hedge funds) ---

Order book observations: Short when more sell than buy, buy when more buy than sell.

Arbitrage: Buy and Sell same stock on different exchanges (NASDAQ/NYSE).

Speed is vital.

--- Inside a Quant Shop ---

"Fat finger": Sold a lot of shares in one trade, compared to over a couple of trades/ days. Usually makes the shares drop in price.

"Portfolio optimizer" algorithm: Inputs current portfolio, N-day forecast, historical prices and risk constrains for target portfolio.

"N-day forecast": Inputs infromation feed, historical prices, and a forecast algorithm (machine learning) to make a forecast.

Information feed: T.R. feed packages, analyst estimates (models).
