--- Events ---

Bollinger bands: 
	Measure extreme price changes using moving averages and standard deviations.

Events: 
	Stock is doing something else than market in general.

More events -> more reliable results.

How to use it?

1. Create several random portfolios, measure performance, average results, to get a baseline.

2. Devise a strategy to beat the random portfolio.

--- Actual vs Adjusted prices ---

Actual:
	The actual closing price as recorded by the exchange.

Adjusted:
	A revised price that accounts for "how much someone made by holding the stock", eg. dividends and splits, to keep track over time.

--- Adjusting for splits example ---
	
Start value: 100 * 50 = 500 USD

	1. Actual price (100 shares) increase from 50 USD to 100 USD.
	2. Actual price (100 shares) splits into 1:2 (200 shares), drops from 100 USD to 50 USD.
	3. Actual price (200 shares) increase from 50 USD to 100 USD.
	4. Actual price (200 shares) splits into 1:4 (400 shares), drops from 100 USD to 50 USD.

End value: 400 * 50 = 2000 USD

Actual price dropped at least 2 over time, adjusted prices increased over time.

--- Adjusting for dividends example ---

Start value (before dividend): x + 1 USD (expected dividend)
	
	1. Stock x increases by 1 USD over a time period.
	2. On dividend day (money from company goes to sharholders), actual prices drops 1 USD to account for less capital in bank, adjusted prices stays the same.

End value (after dividend): x (adjusted price, incl. price increase for period)

--- Gaps in data (NaN) ---

Breaks in trading, before stocks exists, after stocks exists etc.

Fill back: fill NaN backwards using newer data.

Fill forward: fill NaN forwards using older data.

Error in data (bad data) may cause calculation errors, ie wrong factors or using bad fillers.

Examples of bad data:
	
	- Failure to adjust for splits.
	- Orders of magnitude drops, followed by magnitude climbs.
	- Database updates missing significant chunks of data/ symbols.

Bad data may cause automated systems to exploit the bad data and fail real data, it may "discover" something it shouldn't have.

--- Sanity checks for Data Mining ---

- Scan new data for large drops (50%) and gains (200%), usually associated with splits.
- NaNs in DOW stocks.
- Recent adjusted prices less than 0.01.
- NaNs > trading days.

Scrubbing data:
	Remove data for reliability.
	Repair data with multiple sources.
