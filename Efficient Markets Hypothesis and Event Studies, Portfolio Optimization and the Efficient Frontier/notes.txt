--- Two general approaches for determining value ---

1 Technical analysis:
Price and volume only

2 Fundamental analysis: 
Financial statements
P/E ratios, cash on hand, dividends

--- Where does information come from? ---

Price/Volume: the markets
Fundamentals: SEC filings
News: exogenous sources

--- Efficient market hypothesis ---

3 versions:
Weak, semi-strong, strong

Weak: prices reflect all past publicly available information (no profit from technical analysis)
Semi-strong: Weak + prices instantly change to reflect new public information (no profit from technical analysis and fundamental analysis)
Strong: Semi-strong + prices instantly reflect hidden informaton (no profit from insider information)

Not always true, fundamental analysis is correlated with future prices for example.

--- Portfolio optimization ---

Given: A set of equities and target return
Find: Allocation to each equity that minimizes risk

Where 'risk' is volatility (standard deviation), but also amount of draw down.

Consider equites in two dimensions (risk, return) and aim for a portfolio with same, or higher, return with lower risk.

Balance based on 'sharpe ratio', reward / standard deviation of return (risk).

Harry Markowitz got noble price (quantitative finance) for the discovery.

--- Portfolio optimizer program ---

Inputs: Expected return for each equity, volatility (risk) for each equity, target return, 'covariance matrix'.
Outputs: Portfolio weights that minimize risk for target return.

--- Correlation and Covariance ---

Correlation coefficient:
	Number between -1 and 1
	High correlation between stocks (move together) is closer to 1.
	Negative correlation between stocks (move opposite) is closer to -1.
	No correlation (random) is closer to 0.

Leverage anti-correlation between stocks to reduce volatility of portfolio (smooth curve), i.e. lower risk by combining  anti-correlation equites.

--- Efficient frontier ---

Optimal portfolio curve (efficient frontier):
	Lowest risk (many equities)
	Higest risk (one equity)
	Maximum sharpe ratio in middle

--- QSTK optimizer ---

Tutorial 8 for coding examples.

General purpose optimizer:
	Define variables (equity weights)
	Define constrains (min/max weights)
	Define criteria (function of weights)

Optimizer algorithm: tweak weights, check constrains, call function, repeat.
