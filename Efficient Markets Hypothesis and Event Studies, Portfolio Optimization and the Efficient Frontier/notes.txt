--- Two general approaches for determining value ---

1 Technical analysis:
Price and volume only

2 Fundamental analysis: 
Financial statements
P/E ratios, cash on hand, dividends

--- Where does information come from? ---

Price/Volume: the markets
Fundamentals: SEC filings
News: exogenous sources

--- Efficient market hypothesis ---

3 versions:
Weak, semi-strong, strong

Weak: prices reflect all past publicly available information (no profit from technical analysis)
Semi-strong: Weak + prices instantly change to reflect new public information (no profit from technical analysis and fundamental analysis)
Strong: Semi-strong + prices instantly reflect hidden informaton (no profit from insider information)

Not always true, fundamental analysis is correlated with future prices for example.
