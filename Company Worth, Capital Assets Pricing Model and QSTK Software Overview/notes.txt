--- Key terms ---

Intrinsic value: The actual value of a company or asset based on analytical perception, may be be more or less than the current market value.

Capital asset pricing model (CAPM): A model that is used for describing the relationship between risk and return of a security. Compensation in two ways, time value of money and risk.

--- Current value of future income ---

Discount rate = 0.95

Now: USD 1

Year 1: USD 0.95
Year 2: USD 0.95^2
Year 3: USD 0.95^3
.
.
.
Year n = USD 0.95^n

Present value = sum of all years

Example:
Bank -> USD 0.95 -> USD 5 interest -> USD 1

--- Intrinsic value ---

"future income generated by asset and discounting it to present value"

dividend * 1 / (1 - gamma)

Example: 
Gamma = discount rate = 0.95
Dividend = USD 1

1 * 1 / (1 - 0.95) = 20

Present value is equal to USD 20, if dividend is USD 1 every year, forever.

--- Local and Global affects ---

Good/bad news about single CEO makes share price rise/drop, good/bad new about sector makes all shares (locally, region) rise/drop.

--- Company worth ---

Value is sum of book value (assets etc.) and intrinsic value (future returns).

Future returns:
i = dividend return
SUM(discount_rate^i)

Book value:
Total assets - Intangible assets - Liabilities

Market is an efficient news processor (Efficient Market Hypothesis).

Market value (Market Cap) = num_shares_outstanding * price

--- CAPM ---

Index investing: better to invest in a market portfolio than specific stocks.

Assumptions:
Systematic (market) and residual component of return.

Market portfolio (index): S&P 500 (US), FTA (UK), DJ 30, TOPIX (Japan).

Metrics:

Using linear regression (for scatter chart) to find beta and alpha.

daily return = r
Beta = slope of linear regression
Alpa -> information about stock to exploit = y-intercept of linear regression (usually positive if better then market)

Example: 
r_stock = beta_stock * r_market + alpha_stock

Beta (slope of line) and Correlation (scatter of points) are different.

--- How hedge funds use CAPM ---

Expected excess returns are proportional to beta.

> Beta -> > Risk

Beta of portfolio = weighted sum of all betas

r_portfolio = SUM(w_stock * r_stock)

Example(weight): 

XOM USD 1000 = beta 1.0
IBM USD 1000 = beta 2.0

w_stock = 0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 2.0 = 1.5

--- Market risk example ---

Information IBM -> rise (forecast)
Market is going down.
Difference in price points is alpha.

Long position in IBM.
Short the market (SPY in example).

1 = IBM (beta 1.0)
2 = SPY (beta 1.0)

w_1 = 0.5
w_2 = -0.5

r_1 = w_1 * beta + alpha(0) = 0.5 + 0.5*alpha (weighted alpha)
r_2 = w_2 * beta + alpha(0) = -0.5 + 0

Total return (long IBM and short market): 
r_1 + r_2 = 0.5*alpha

Short market to remove risk.
