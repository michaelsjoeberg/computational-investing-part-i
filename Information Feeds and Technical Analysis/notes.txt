--- Technical Analysis ---

	- Computing indicators based on historical data and volume only
	- Indicators are calculated from recent prices and volume to predict future price movements
	- Indicators are "heuristics"

Controversial subject:
	Many don't believe in the value of TA
	Depends on information in historical price and volume
	Leverages psychology of the investor and market physics

Three "Branches":
	1. Sentiment Indicators -> emotions of investors
	2. Flow-of-Funds Indicators -> amount of cash going in or out, market capacity to buy or sell
	3. Market Structure Indicators -> most indicators fall in this group

Underlying Value:
	- Assumption is that there is a true underlying value for the asset
	- Emotions and market structure cause price to deviate
	- If we can estimate the underlying value, we can find arbitrage opportunities

Examples:
	- SMA (Simple Moving Average)
	- MACD (Moving Averages Convergence Divergence)
	- BOLL (Bollinger Bands)

Convert to Standard Units:
	- Usually -1.0 to +1.0
	- More convenient for defining event and for Machine Learning

--- Bollinger Bands ---

Actual price, rolling mean, upper band (sell  signal), and lower band (buy signal)

Upper band: 10 days rolling mean + standard deviation
Lower band: 10 days rolling mean - standard deviation

Developed by John Bollinger

Idea: Indicator should adapt to volatility of the stock price

--- Compute Bollinger Bands ---

	- Read in historical closing prices
	- mid = "rolling" mean over look-back period
	- std = "rolling" stdev over look-back period
	- upper = min + std
	- lower = mid - std

Current "value" of Bollinger:
	If current price at Upper band = 1.0
	If current price at Lower band = -1.0

Val = (price - mid/std)
