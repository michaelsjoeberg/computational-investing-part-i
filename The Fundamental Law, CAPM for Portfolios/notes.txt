--- Thought Experiment: Coin flipping ---

Key Objectives:
	- information ratio (IR)
	- information coefficient (IC)
	- strategy breadth (BR)
	- Fundamental Law

Stock trade = Bet
Coin flip = Bet

Uncertainty = Beta
Coin bias = Alpha
	51% heads

--- Conditions of One Bet ---

We bet one token

Win: Now own two tokens
Lose: Now own zero tokens

Case 1: One bet with a USD 1000 token
	0.51 * 1000 + 0.49 * -1000 = USD 20

Case 2: 1000 bets with a USD 1 token
	1000 * (0.51 * 1 + 0.49 * -1) = USD 20

--- Consider reward/risk (sharpe ratio) ---

Risk measure 1: possibility to lose everything

Case 1: 49%
Case 2: 0.49^1000 (small!)

Risk measure 2: standard deviation

Case 1: STDEV(1000, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0) = USD 31.62
	USD 20 / USD 31.62 = 0.63

Case 2: STDEV(1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, ..., -1) = USD 1.00
	USD 20 / USD 1 = 20.0

SR(case 2) = SR(case 1) * SQRT(1000)
	20 = 0.63 * SQRT(1000) = 0.63 * 31.62 = 20

Same expected return, but multiple bets has lower risk, lower stdev, and higher reward/risk ratio.

Generally:
	SR(multi) = C * alpha * SQRT(bets)

	Higher alpha = higher Sharpe Ratio
	More bets = higher Sharpe Ratio
	Sharpe Ratio grows as the SQRT of breadth

--- Observation ---

Jim Simons (rentec) and Warren Buffet (BRK) offer the same performance

Buffet's portfolio contains few equities:
	54% in just 3 stocks (2010)

Simons trades actively (100ks/day)

--- Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management ---

IR (information ratio) = mean(alpha) / stdev(alpha)

IC (information coefficient) = correlation of forecast to actual return

Breadth (BR) = number of opportunities to execute

Fundamental law: IR = IC * SQRT(BR)

Fundamental (think, reasearch, invest a lot of time) doesn't scale.

Computational (gather, analyse, compute) scale.

--- Fundamental law example ---

Example Reward/Risk (sharpe) = 3.0

Fundamental approach:
	IR = IC * SQRT(trades)
	3.0 = skill * SQRT(trades)
	skill = 0.27

Computational approach:
	Assuming 1/100 skill = 0.27 / 100 = 0.0027

	IR = IC * SQRT(trades)
	3.0 = 0.0027 * SQRT(trades)
	trades = (3.0 / 0.0027)^2 -> approx. 10,000 times more than fundamental

Conclusion:
	Fundamnetal -> great skill, few trades
	Computational -> less skill, many opportunities

	Two ways to succeed -> Skill and Breath

--- CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) Recap ---

Key Objectives:
	- recap and add to CAPM toolset
	- understand CAPM for portfolios
	- understand portfolio beta and portfolio alpha
	- learn how to manage risk

CAPM for individual stock:
	Return = Beta (market) + Alpha (skill and random)

Extend to portfolios:
	h(stock) = percentage holdings in stock
	return(portfolio) = sum( h(stock) * r(stocks) )

Example:
	h(1) = 0.25
	h(2) = 0.75

	Beta(1) = 3.0
	Beta(2) = 1.0

	r(portfolio) = h(1) * (Beta(1)(r(market) + alpha(1))) + h(2) * (Beta(2)(r(market) + alpha(2)))

	-> 1.5r(market) + 0.25alpha(1) + 0.75alpha(2)

	market is impossible to control
	alpha can be controlled

--- Removing market risk ---

Beta -> volatility to market

Stock 1:
	Will go down relative to market
	Has a Beta of 2.0

Stock 2:
	Will go up relative to market
	Has a Beta of 1.0

Plan:
	-50% Stock 1 (short)
	+50% Stock 2 (long)

r(portfolio) = Beta * r(market) + Alpha(portfolio)

stdev(Beta(portfolio) * r(market)) -> market risk
stdev(Alpha(portfolio)) -> residual risk

--- Example for removing market risk using CAPM ---

Find weightings (h from previous example) to zero portfolio Beta

Holdings:
	h(1) = -0.33
	h(2) = 0.66

Beta:
	B(1) = 2.0
	B(2) = 1.0

Beta total:
	B(portfolio) = -0.33 * 2.0 + 0.66 * 1.0 = 0

Return:
	r(portfolio) = 0 + -0.33alpha(1) + 0.66alpha(2)

Conclusion:
	- Can reduce market risk by zeroing out Beta
	- This is core concept for hedge funds
	- Portfolio optimizers do this
