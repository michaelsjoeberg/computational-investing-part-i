--- Current value of future income ---

Discount rate = 0.95

Now: USD 1

Year 1: USD 0.95
Year 2: USD 0.95^2
Year 3: USD 0.95^3
.
.
.
Year n = USD 0.95^n

Present value = sum of all years

Example:
Bank -> USD 0.95 -> USD 5 interest -> USD 1

--- Intrinsic value ---

"future income generated by asset and discounting it to present value"

dividend * 1 / (1 - gamma)

Example: 
Gamma = discount rate = 0.95
Dividend = USD 1

1 * 1 / (1 - 0.95) = 20

Present value is equal to USD 20, if dividend is USD 1 every year, forever.
